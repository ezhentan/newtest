  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">My name is E-Zhen Tan, a Year 2 undergraduate at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. As an aspiring data scientist, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. I love discovering the versatility of code, from using Python to create dictionaries (actual ones, not the data type '{}') to creating websites with R.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">From the past semester of university, I took modules that taught me how to read and analyse data using Python and IBM SPSS Modeler. In the Python Programming module, I learnt how to import data from <i>text</i>, <i>json</i> and <i>csv</i> files and use the <i>pandas</i> and <i>matplotlib</i> libraries to create dataframes and plot graphs for data visualization.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">In addition to Python, I took a Data Mining module that required the use of IBM SPSS Modeler to find relationships in data. For this module, the main application of the Modeler was for investigating customer purchasing behaviour between products. Equipped with these skills, I am able to manage data and assist in giving meaning to the vast sea of data available. My portfolio of prior school projects are linked <a href="https://github.com/ezhentan/schoolprojects">here</a> and in the tab, <strong>GitHub-Portfolio</strong>, above.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">A self-directed learner at heart, I have pushed myself to learn other codes beyond what is taught in the school curriculum. In building this website using R, I have also used the HTML language to format the text.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Apart from these technical skills, my part-time job as a tutor at Writers@Work Enrichment, a local tuition that specialises in teaching English Language for Primary and Secondary levels, has also helped me to hone my communication skills. Be it in writing when I am marking scripts or speaking when teaching a class, it is important that my language is sufficiently clear to ensure that the students will be able to understand the lesson and their mistakes.</p><br>
