  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">My name is E-Zhen Tan, a fresh graduate currently working as a Data Analyst at NCS Group. I love discovering the versatility of code, from using Python to create dictionaries (actual ones, not the data type '{}') to creating websites with R.</p>
  
<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Having studied Business Analytics in university and from my previous internship, I have gained experience in using Python to analyse data and build machine learning models. My previous stint as a Data Science Intern gave me real-world experience in using Python for machine learning, and since then, I have continued pursuing this area of interest by taking the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. The types of projects I have done include:</p>
  <ul style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px"> 
    <li>Text classification</li>
    <li>Image classification</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
    <li>Web scraping with BeautifulSoup</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">In addition to Python, I am able to create visuals and graphs of present and historical data using Tableau. Equipped with these skills, I am able to manage data and assist in giving meaning to the vast sea of data available. My portfolio of prior projects are linked <a href="https://github.com/ezhentan/schoolprojects">here</a> and in the tab, <strong>GitHub</strong>, above.</p>
  
    <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">I am fortunate and grateful to have been able to gain experience from 3 different internships in 3 different domains - Data Science Intern at Jewel Paymentech, Data Analyst Intern at Shopback, and International Business Development Intern at Love, Bonito. Each internship taught me invaluable lessons, from technical skills to better workplace communication to business mindsets.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">A self-directed learner at heart, I have also pushed myself to learn other codes beyond what is taught in the school curriculum. In building this website using R, I have also used the HTML language to format the text.</p>
  
  <h2>Other skills</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Apart from these technical skills, my ongoing stint as the President of Dance(x) has helped me to hone my leadership skills. As part of the founding team of the Interest Group (IG), we started the IG when SUSS first started this initiative. While the IG does not have external achievements, such as performances or competitions, since it is new and we are focusing on foundation first, we have managed to ensure that all genres are bonded and running smoothly despite the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Additionally, my part-time job as a tutor at Writers@Work Enrichment, a local tuition centre that specialises in teaching English Language for Primary and Secondary levels, has also helped me to hone my communication skills. Be it in writing when I am marking scripts or speaking when teaching a class, it is important that my language is sufficiently clear to ensure that the students will be able to understand the lesson and their mistakes.</p><br>
