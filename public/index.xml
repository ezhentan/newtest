      <description>My name is E-Zhen Tan. I am a Year 2 undergraduate at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Sciences in Business Analytics. I love discovering the versatility of code, from using Python to create dictionaries (actual ones, not the data type {}) to creating websites with R.
