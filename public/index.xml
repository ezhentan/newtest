      <description>As this was my first time in Myanmar, the trip was incredibly eye-opening. After hearing from various industry professionals about the achievements that the businesses have achieved and challenges that they are facing, my impression of working in Myanmar has changed. Many may see Myanmar as an underdeveloped country, but the economy is making slow and steady progress. With the government gradually adjusting regulations, such as liberalising the insurance industry, I am sure that Myanmar will, in no time, be on par with, or become even better than, its ASEAN counterparts.</description>
