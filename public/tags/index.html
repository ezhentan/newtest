  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">My name is E-Zhen Tan, a final year undergraduate at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics with Minor in Algorithmic Development, I love discovering the versatility of code, from using Python to create dictionaries (actual ones, not the data type '{}') to creating websites with R.</p>
  
<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">From the past semesters of university and from my previous internship, I have gained experience in using Python and IBM SPSS Modeler to analyse data and build machine learning models. My previous stint as a Data Science Intern gave me real-world experience in using Python for machine learning, and since then, I have continued pursuing this area of interest by taking the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. The types of projects I have done include:</p>
  <ul style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px"> 
    <li>Text classification</li>
    <li>Image classification</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
    <li>Web scraping with BeautifulSoup</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">My latest internship at ShopBack has also pushed me to learn SQL, which is part of the day-to-day work of a data analyst there. Throughout this internship, my work consisted of creating dashboards and reports to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions, and I also assisted the team in the data migration to another platform. These tasks taught me invaluable lessons:</p>
    <ul style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px"> 
    <li>Be more critical when taking on tasks</li>
      <ul>
        <li>There are many occasions when stakeholders approach the team to ask for certain data. However, instead of immediately agreeing to take on the task, it is important to clarify the stakeholder's purpose of requesting the data. This will help to ensure that I know exactly what I am pulling the data for, and with this information, I am better able to provide suggestions, such as whether the data will really answer the stakeholder's question or if there are better ways to go about it.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Iteration is part and parcel of work</li>
      <ul>
        <li>When coming up with reports and dashboards, it is more common than not that changes will be made according to stakeholders' requests. Initially, I perceived changes to my work as a sign that I was not doing well. However, a few months in, I realised that this is actually normal and these iterations help ensure that the reports and dashboards meet the stakeholders' needs as much as possible. That said, in order to reduce unnecessary iterations, as mentioned in the previous point, I do need to be more critical and ask questions first instead of jumping right into the code after getting the request.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">In addition to Python, I am able to create visuals and graphs of present and historical data using Tableau. Equipped with these skills, I am able to manage data and assist in giving meaning to the vast sea of data available. My portfolio of prior projects are linked <a href="https://github.com/ezhentan/schoolprojects">here</a> and in the tab, <strong>GitHub</strong>, above.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">A self-directed learner at heart, I have pushed myself to learn other codes beyond what is taught in the school curriculum. In building this website using R, I have also used the HTML language to format the text.</p>
  
  <h2>Other skills</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Apart from these technical skills, my ongoing stint as the President of Dance(x) has helped me to hone my leadership skills. As part of the founding team of the Interest Group (IG), we started the IG when SUSS first started this initiative. While the IG does not have external achievements, such as performances or competitions, since it is new and we are focusing on foundation first, we have managed to ensure that all genres are bonded and running smoothly despite the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Additionally, my part-time job as a tutor at Writers@Work Enrichment, a local tuition centre that specialises in teaching English Language for Primary and Secondary levels, has also helped me to hone my communication skills. Be it in writing when I am marking scripts or speaking when teaching a class, it is important that my language is sufficiently clear to ensure that the students will be able to understand the lesson and their mistakes.</p><br>
