  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">My name is E-Zhen Tan, a data analyst by training. I love discovering the versatility of code, from using Python to create dictionaries (actual ones, not the data type '{}') to creating websites with R.</p>
  
  <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Having studied Business Analytics in university and from my previous internship, I have gained experience in using Python to analyse data and build machine learning models. My previous stint as a Data Science Intern gave me real-world experience in using Python for machine learning, and since then, I have continued pursuing this area of interest by taking the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. My portfolio of prior projects are linked <a href="https://github.com/ezhentan/schoolprojects">here</a> and in the tab, <strong>GitHub</strong>, above. The types of projects I have done include:</p>
  <ul style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px"> 
    <li>Text classification</li>
    <li>Image classification</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis</li>
    <li>Web scraping with BeautifulSoup</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">In addition to Python, my most recent role as Data Analyst has exposed me to the steps in an end-to-end project. As a Data Analyst, I have learned to:</p>
  <ul style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">
    <li>Communicate with stakeholders to gather their requirements to fulfill their use cases</li>
    <li>Clarify and understand the business objective of the dashboard</li>
    <li>Use Qlik Sense to develop dashboards</li>
    <li>Create clear UAT test cases to test the functionality of the dashboard in the different environments and for the user to vet</li>
  </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">I am fortunate and grateful to have been able to gain experience from 3 different internships in 3 different domains - Data Science Intern at Jewel Paymentech, Data Analyst Intern at Shopback, and International Business Development Intern at Love, Bonito. Each internship taught me invaluable lessons, from technical skills to better workplace communication to business mindsets.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">A self-directed learner at heart, I have also pushed myself to learn other codes beyond what is taught in the school curriculum. In building this website using R, I have also used the HTML language to format the text.</p>
  
  <h2>Other skills</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Apart from these technical skills, my stint as the President of Dance(x) has helped me to hone my leadership skills. As part of the founding team of the Interest Group (IG), we started the IG when SUSS first started this initiative. Since its founding, the IG has participated in various performances and competitions, with my team from Dance(KDC) achieving first runner up in the Paym Youth Competition in 2022.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px">Additionally, my part-time job as a tutor at Writers@Work Enrichment, a local tuition centre that specialises in teaching English Language for Primary and Secondary levels, has also helped me to hone my communication skills. Be it in writing when I am marking scripts or speaking when teaching a class, it is important that my language is sufficiently clear to ensure that the students will be able to understand the lesson and their mistakes.</p><br>
