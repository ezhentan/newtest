This trip was organised for students to see how the workings of companies in Yangon, Myanmar. The reflection below is my insights from this week-long trip.

As this was my first time in Myanmar, the trip was incredibly eye-opening. After hearing from various industry professionals about the achievements that the businesses have achieved and challenges that they are facing, my impression of working in Myanmar has changed. Many may see Myanmar as an underdeveloped country, but the economy is making slow and steady progress. With the government gradually adjusting regulations, such as liberalising the insurance industry, I am sure that Myanmar will, in no time, be on par with, or become even better than, its ASEAN counterparts.

The observations made during the trip will definitely aid me in my future career and personal development, as it has taught me to be more open-minded. At first, I thought Myanmar would not be a good place to have a career. Like most people, I was aiming to work either locally or in developed countries such as the United States. However, the trip has changed this perspective for me. With so much room in the market for growth, it is hard to ignore the potential that exist in the Burmese economy.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Using the insurance industry as an example, with current technology and data, the industry has the potential to leapfrog the rest of Southeast Asia. Compared to other countries where the growth is gradual due to limitations in technologies, Myanmar has not fully harnessed modern technology yet. This is because Myanmar was a closed economy until 2015. In addition, the Burmese companies do not have legacy standards to meet as compared to the large foreign companies such as Great Eastern. In addition, Myanmar’s insurance penetration rate as a percentage of GDP is still approximately 3% below that of ASEAN’s. The fast-growing mass and affluent consumer segments will also come to be helpful in improving the growth of the industry, as demand for insurance is likely to rise. There is still so much more that the economy can maximise on. Hence, if given a choice to work in Myanmar, I would certainly not shun the idea.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Myanmar’s culture has definitely played a huge role on the country development. Firstly, the Burmese people are not ready for things to go completely online. For example, in the case of City Mart, they have an online store, but they have no plans to reduce any brick-and-mortar stores. This is because the people’s lifestyle and pace of life is not very fast-paced, and they do not really require things to be ready in a snap. Rather, they still prefer to go the stores to purchase their goods. Hence, City Mart is going in the direction of having an online store as an alternative method for the people to shop, instead of moving their operations completely online. This is definitely very different from Singapore, where things are fast-paced and consumers are looking for instant gratification. As such, Singapore’s culture has allowed the country to develop as a Smart Nation.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Secondly, ever since the 2003 Myanmar banking crisis, majority of the people have lost their trust in the banks. Currently, most keep their savings with themselves rather than deposit it into the banks. As a result, a very small percentage of the population have bank accounts. This makes development on industries such as e-commerce tougher, since the main selling point of buying things online is the convenience of not having to use cash. While this has been mitigated with cash on delivery being a widely available service, it does not hide the fact that e-wallets are tough to implement, since most do not have bank accounts. As such, Myanmar is a cash society, unlike Singapore, where it is transitioning to become cashless.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
There are several challenges faced by Myanmar. One challenge is the lack of emphasis on a good education. This also comes as a result of the culture, where child labour is acceptable, so there is little reason for children to attend school when they can go out to work and support their family. This will definitely serve as a hindrance to future economic growth, as a large percentage of the young labour force will be unskilled, and the vicious cycle of poverty will not be able to be broken. Hence, I think that the myME project that brings education to children working in teashops is particularly meaningful, as they are helping to tackle an issue that will affect the country in the long-term.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Another challenge I see that Myanmar is facing is the regulations. The many regulations the government put in place, such as for foreign investment, is for protecting the profits of the local companies, even though it can impact the progress as the local companies may not have as much funding or experience. It is a fine line to walk when balancing the interests of the companies and how fast the companies and the country should progress. However, the government is slowly reducing the tight regulations, such as removing the regulation that in joint ventures, the foreign company can only have 35% of shares, while the local company must have at least 65%. In fact, there are already several foreign insurance companies who are applying for 100% licenses. Hence, with time, this may no longer be a challenge faced by the country.

If fellow classmates were to venture into Myanmar, I would advise them that for the current situation that Myanmar is in, trying to go fully automated is not feasible and not in the best interest of the people. The speaker from the Asia World Port Management (AWPM) mentioned that as manpower is abundant in the country, it is not worth going fully automated and leaving these people unemployed as their jobs are replaced by machines. This can even lead to social unrest, which will be detrimental to the country. Hence, it is important to put ourselves in the people’s shoes and adapt our mindsets to the country and their needs. We should not be assuming that whatever Singapore does should be implemented in other countries as well. When making decisions, it is always important to respect the people first. In the situation where going automation is inevitable, there should at least be sufficient measures put in place to support the displaced workers during the transition.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Out of the following aspects – culture, people, government, infrastructure and education – I think that government is the most important factor that can speed up Myanmar’s growth. Ultimately, the government is the main party that can impact the other four factors. For example, the government can make early education compulsory, similar to Singapore’s compulsory primary education policy. This will ensure that the younger generation will at least have a basic level of education and may even serve to discourage child labour. As such, as the children grow older, they will have the knowledge and ability to find better jobs and break out of the cycle of poverty. By ensuring that the people are educated, the country can then leverage on the population to grow the economy. Hence, I think that the government is the most important aspect.
