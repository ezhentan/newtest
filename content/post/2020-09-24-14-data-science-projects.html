<p>This post serves as a documentation of 14 Data Science projects I am committing to complete. Why am I doing this? Recently, I came across a video by Thomas Frank (from College Info Geek) about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_FSSC-ixK8">the 1% Rule</a>, and it really got me thinking. In essence, the 1% rule states that with every new project or work, there should be an improvement of 1%. This may seem small, but with time and with more projects, it will not take long for the progress to increase exponentially.</p>
<p>As such, I decided to embark on a series of projects that I can do to kickstart the consistency that I would need to truly capitalize on the 1% rule. For this post, I have followed the project ideas from Terence Sâ€™s (2020) post, <em>14 Data Science Projects to do During Your 14 Day Quarantine</em>, linked <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/14-data-science-projects-to-do-during-your-14-day-quarantine-8bd60d1e55e1">here</a>. The projects consist of 3 Visualization, 6 Exploratory Data Analysis, 5 Predictive Modelling projects.</p>
<p>With this post, I aim to upload my outputs here, and list my learning points and/or improvements after each project. Additionally, all outputs will be from code, unless otherwise stated (when I have produced the outputs in Tableau).</p>
<div id="project-1-visualization-coronavirus-and-the-global-spread-over-time" class="section level2">
<h2>Project 1: [Visualization] Coronavirus and the Global Spread Over Time</h2>
<p><em>Date completed: 2020-09-24</em><br />
</p>
<p>Learning points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Plotly for the first time in Python, and converting the code to be used in R</li>
<li>Data Frame manipulation in R</li>
</ul>
<p>Area(s) to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an interactive chart with sliders in R to show the spread of the coronavirus over time. Managed to do it in Python with Plotly Express, but this is not available in R.</li>
</ul>
