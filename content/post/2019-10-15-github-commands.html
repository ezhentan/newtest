<p>This guide is what I have learnt from building my GitHub portfolio. It also serves as a reminder for me when I need to refer to the codes again.</p>
<div id="step-0-install-git-in-terminal-if-you-have-not-done-so" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 0: Install Git in Terminal (if you have not done so)</h1>
<p>Whether you have Git already in your command shell can be easily verified with one command. Run <code>git</code> in your shell. If it says <code>command not found</code>, then you can go ahead and install Git. If Git is already installed, Terminal will list out some information and commands that you can run to use Git.</p>
<p>Now that Git is installed, we can move on to Step 1.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1-create-a-repository" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 1: Create a Repository</h1>
<p>This will be done in the GitHub website, rather self-explanatory. For my repository, I named in ‘Projects’.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-create-a-file-in-your-computer" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 2: Create a File in your computer</h1>
<p>This can be done in Terminal using the following code:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>mkdir Projects</code></pre>
<p><em>Note that the name of the folder must correspond to the name of the repository made in Step 1.</em></p>
<p>Once the folder has been created, a good practice is to create a README.md file to explain what the contents of the repository is about. This can be done from GitHub, but we shall try this from Terminal instead. The <code>echo</code> command will create a new file in the directory.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo &#39;#Projects&#39; &gt;&gt; README.md
cat README.md</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-3-initialise-and-commit-changes" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 3: Initialise and commit changes</h1>
<pre class="bash"><code>git init
git commit -m &#39;README file&#39;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-4-add-a-remote" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 4: Add a remote</h1>
<pre class="bash"><code>git add remote add origin &lt;repository URL&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-5-push-the-changes-up-to-the-repository" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 5: Push the changes up to the repository</h1>
<pre class="bash"><code>git push -u origin master</code></pre>
<p>Once the changes are pushed, refresh your GitHub repository and admire your handiwork!</p>
</div>
