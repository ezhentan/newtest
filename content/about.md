My name is E-Zhen Tan. I am a Year 2 undergraduate at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Sciences in Business Analytics. 

My portfolio of prior school projects are linked above under 'GitHub-Portfolio'. 

This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
