My name is E-Zhen Tan. I am a Year 2 undergraduate at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Sciences in Business Analytics. I love discovering the versatility of code, from using Python to create dictionaries (actual ones, not the data type `{}`) to creating websites with R. 

My portfolio of prior school projects are linked [here](https://github.com/ezhentan/schoolprojects) and in the tab, **GitHub-Portfolio**, above.
